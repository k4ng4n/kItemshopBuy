# kItemshopBuy
Runes of Magic Addon. Buy up to 999 items very fast from itemshop. <br/>
Depending of which version of AdvancedCashShop you have it could collide with it. If your AdvancedCashShop *ONLY* adds the buttons to the "Send Present" Frame then it is all fine. If your AdvancedCashShop adds the +10 and -10 Buttons to the "Buy" Frame for yourself then it collides with kItemshopBuy and kItemshopBuy doesn't work properly. <br/>
In the following picture you see how it should look if the addon works. <br/>
