# kItemshopBuy
Author: Kangan  
  
Runes of Magic Addon. Buy up to 999 items very fast from itemshop.  
Depending of which version of AdvancedCashShop you have it could collide with it. If your AdvancedCashShop *ONLY* adds the buttons to the "Send Present" Frame then it is all fine. If your AdvancedCashShop adds the +10 and -10 Buttons to the "Buy" Frame for yourself then it collides with kItemshopBuy and kItemshopBuy doesn't work properly.  
In the following picture you see how it should look if the addon works.
